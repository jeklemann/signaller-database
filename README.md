**Terrible Signaller Database Program**

**Please keep in mind that the importer does not exactly work perfectly, requires fiddling and requires the exact CSV file from our current database**

**Usage**
Rename the login-example.txt to login.txt, and replace "username" with your database username. "password" is the password.
Do not add ANY whitespace. Line one has username only, a new line, and then the password on line two

Docs is ignored because it isn't actually documentation, just code screenshots.
